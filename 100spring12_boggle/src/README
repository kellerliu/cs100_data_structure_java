Comment: 
This is a highly complex assignment, given the number of classes in the package, and the inner relationship between these classes. 

GoodWordOnBoardFinder is a good practice of recursion and backtracking.
BoardFirstAutoPlayer also uses recursion and backtracking, but is even more complex, especially in order to keep good track of all the status in checking valid word or prefix.
