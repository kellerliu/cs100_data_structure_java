Comment: 
The Tourney and WordLadder are relatively easy, while TournamentRanker and AllWordLadders are extension that are more difficult, especially AllWordLadders. 

In solving AllWordLadders, I used the same strategy as introduced in NumberGame on Feb29's class, which tracks the status of the word list.

However, the main problem with AllWordLadders is, although theoretically the methodology is correct, it is not efficient enough, and fail to pass #10.

Will other data structure such as TreeSet help promote the efficiency of solving this problem?
