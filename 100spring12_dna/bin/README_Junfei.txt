Comment: Bioinformatics is always my favorite so I like this assignment a lot. Through
the assignment I am more aware of the power and efficiency of linked lists in java in 
handling specific problems. I hope this class can provide more problems related to 
biology in future.  

We did the extra credit, too. Basically a HashMap was created to link unique strings 
(keys) stored in original nodes to their corresponding reverse strings (values). If a 
string shows up again in the Linked list, our code retrieves its reverse string from
the HashMap rather than call the .reverse method, which saves memories for making a 
duplicate copy of the reverse string.
