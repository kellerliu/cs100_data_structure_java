your impressions of the assignment: 
This is a good practice and involves lots of thoughts and work.

It seems like the private int commonCount(String a, String b)initially has an error in setting the range of k and j.
Fortunately, when the lengths of two string are the same, it really doesn't mind.

The SmartGuess is a little bit difficult, especially since I was trying to avoid using iterator.

The fact that a word can have multiple same letters makes this assignment more complicated, 
because under such circumstance it is possible that 
commonCount(String a, String b) !=commonCount(String b, String a)
