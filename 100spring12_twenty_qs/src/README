Comment: 
This is a very lovely assignment, relatively easy but definitely a good practice of reading and writing files.

Regarding the robustness of GUI coding:
What if the player types in nothing, or clicks cancel, or even closes the dialog panel.
Or, what if the player types in some info that is already in the tree?
Should the code check these cases and be able to provide the player chances to correct these mistakes?
